# DataAnalysisEarthquakeData-
Knowledge discovery in earthquake dataset in R.

This project focuses more on knowledge discovery through data prepartion and analysis than modeling. 

We are using earthquake dataset provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database) as well as from [National Geographical Data Center](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1).  

* Objective: 
  * To analyze the intensity of the earthquake
  * To calculate seismic risk and fracture risk all over the world over the time
  * To seek any additional factors influencing or establishing earthquake pattern
  * To come up with business strategy which could affect policies for administration and  infrastructure sector
  
* Strategy:
  * Follow EDA approach and explore data
  * Clean the data, find out any anomalies and remove them 
  * Subset the relevant data to get solutions for specific problems given in data problem definition
  * Apply supervised learning techniques and statistical significance testing to establish a relationship between given attributes
  * Use visualization approach to present the pattern in data and significant results
 
* Dataset:
  * Extensive seismic databaseÂ provided by The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) 
  * Includes a record of every earthquake with a reported magnitude 5.5 or higher since 1965 
  * Also contains the date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source of earthquake for each record
  
* Techniques used for data analysis:
  * Association Rules
  * Decision Trees
  * Linear and Logistic Regression Model (Statistical testing)
  * KNN - K-Nearest Neighbour Model 
  * Data Visualization using Maps, Graphs and Heatmap
